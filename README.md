# hands-on-exam
Repo for a trainee test

 - One branch was created for each question.
 - Simple code didn't require fancy project structure.

# Project structure:
 - test.py: tests for all the questions
 - fibonacci.py: question 1
 - palindrome.py: question 2
 - prime.py: question 3
 - sort.py: question 4
